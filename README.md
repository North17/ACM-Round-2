# ACM-Round-2

This repository contains documentation of the basic skills that I learnt as part of ACM recruitment process.

## Verticals:

- Frontend Development
- Backend Development

## A brief explanation of some folders:

- Frontend:
  - I have some prior experience with frontend development and had learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and basic JS a few weeks ago. I have added these files into the folder named "Frontend Basics"
  - I have also added the links to some of my previous website projects:
    - [Portfolio site](https://north17.github.io/Marc-s-Portfolio-Website/) - [Portfolio Repository](https://github.com/North17/Marc-s-Portfolio-Website)
    - [GeeksforGeeks clone site](https://north17.github.io/Geeks-for-Geeks-clone/) - [GeeksforGeeks Repository](https://github.com/North17/Geeks-for-Geeks-clone)
  - All other files and folders include recent work
  
 
- Backend:
  - I also have some prior experience with MySQL from school. I have added these files into the folder named "SQL Basics". These are just text files of queries and outputs along with some python files using mysqlconnector module.
  - All other files and folders include recent work
